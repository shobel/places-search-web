LICENSING INFORMATION FOR LONI QC 

The LONI QC platform is comprised of a variety interconnected components that work together to do quality control analysis and allow users to more easily evaluate image quality.

The core components are developed by the Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI). These softwares deal with communication between systems and control how data is collected, managed, analyzed, and displayed and how users interact with the data. They are supported by the LONI Licensing agreement (http://www.loni.usc.edu/Software/license.php). 

The second group consists of third party programs developed outside of LONI and are used mostly for image processing. Each of these programs are supported by a different license. Below is a list of all software used by the LONI QC platform and the corresponding license that supports them.
